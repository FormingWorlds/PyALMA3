This directory contains my attempt at porting ALMA3 to Python. ~It is functional but does not reproduce the numerical results of the Fortran version~. It is apparently functional and reproduces the numerical results of the Fortran code (no extensive tests have been performed, however).

The notebook KelvinSphere.ipynb uses the ALMA3 Python module to compute tidal LNs for a uniform sphere and compares results with analytical expressions.

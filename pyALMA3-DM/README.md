This directory contains my attempt at porting ALMA3 to Python. ~It is functional but does not reproduce the numerical results of the Fortran version~. It is apparently functional and reproduces the numerical results of the Fortran code (no extensive tests have been performed, however). See test_alma-REV3.py for usage.
